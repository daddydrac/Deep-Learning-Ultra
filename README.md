# Deep Learning Ultra
Open source Deep Learning Containers (DLCs) are a set of Docker images for training and serving models in PyTorch, OpenCV (compiled for GPU), TensorFlow 2 for GPU, PyG and NVIDIA RAPIDS


### Ultra easy deployment

```docker-compose up --build -d```


### Requirements
 - Linux configured with ```nvidia_docker2```, CUDA 12, NVIDIA Drivers v.525+
 - NVIDIA GPU ```-ARCH_7.5+```


## Deep Learning Container Services

1. Deep Learning Notebook, or you can mount VSCode to ```/app``` | [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888)
2. MLFlow is an open source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle, see more [here](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/what-is-mlflow.html) 
 | [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
3. Tensorboard povides the visualization and tooling needed for machine learning experimentation | [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006)
4. Seldon Model Serving: If you have a trained MLflow model you are able to deploy one (or several) of the versions saved using Seldonâ€™s prepackaged MLflow server, ports ```5555``` is for RESTful services, and ```9992``` is gRPC.
